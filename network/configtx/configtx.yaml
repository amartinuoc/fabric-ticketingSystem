#   CAPABILITIES
#
#   This section defines the capabilities of fabric network. This is a new
#   concept as of v1.1.0 and should not be utilized in mixed networks with
#   v1.0.x peers and orderers.  Capabilities define features which must be
#   present in a fabric binary for that binary to safely participate in the
#   fabric network.  For instance, if a new MSP type is added, newer binaries
#   might recognize and validate the signatures from this type, while older
#   binaries without this support would be unable to validate those
#   transactions.  This could lead to different versions of the fabric binaries
#   having different world states.  Instead, defining a capability for a channel
#   informs those binaries without this capability that they must cease
#   processing transactions until they have been upgraded.  For v1.0.x if any
#   capabilities are defined (including a map with all capabilities turned off)
#   then the v1.0.x peer will deliberately crash.

#
################################################################################
Orderer: &OrdererDefaults
  # Orderer Type: The orderer implementation to start.
  # Available types are "solo", "kafka" and "etcdraft".
  OrdererType: etcdraft

  # Addresses used to be the list of orderer addresses that clients and peers
  # could connect to.  However, this does not allow clients to associate orderer
  # addresses and orderer organizations which can be useful for things such
  # as TLS validation.  The preferred way to specify orderer addresses is now
  # to include the OrdererEndpoints item in your org definition
  Addresses:
    - orderer.uoctfm.com:7050

  # Batch Timeout: The amount of time to wait before creating a batch
  BatchTimeout:
    2s

  # Batch Size: Controls the number of messages batched into a block.
  # The orderer views messages opaquely, but typically, messages may
  # be considered to be Fabric transactions.  The 'batch' is the group
  # of messages in the 'data' field of the block.  Blocks will be a few kb
  # larger than the batch size, when signatures, hashes, and other metadata
  # is applied.
  BatchSize:

    # Max Message Count: The maximum number of messages to permit in a
    # batch.  No block will contain more than this number of messages.
    MaxMessageCount: 10

    # Absolute Max Bytes: The absolute maximum number of bytes allowed for
    # the serialized messages in a batch. The maximum block size is this value
    # plus the size of the associated metadata (usually a few KB depending
    # upon the size of the signing identities). Any transaction larger than
    # this value will be rejected by ordering.
    # It is recommended not to exceed 49 MB, given the default grpc max message size of 100 MB
    # configured on orderer and peer nodes (and allowing for message expansion during communication).
    AbsoluteMaxBytes: 99 MB

    # Preferred Max Bytes: The preferred maximum number of bytes allowed
    # for the serialized messages in a batch. Roughly, this field may be considered
    # the best effort maximum size of a batch. A batch will fill with messages
    # until this size is reached (or the max message count, or batch timeout is
    # exceeded).  If adding a new message to the batch would cause the batch to
    # exceed the preferred max bytes, then the current batch is closed and written
    # to a block, and a new batch containing the new message is created.  If a
    # message larger than the preferred max bytes is received, then its batch
    # will contain only that message.  Because messages may be larger than
    # preferred max bytes (up to AbsoluteMaxBytes), some batches may exceed
    # the preferred max bytes, but will always contain exactly one transaction.
    PreferredMaxBytes: 512 KB

  # Max Channels is the maximum number of channels to allow on the ordering
  # network. When set to 0, this implies no maximum number of channels.
  MaxChannels: 0

  # EtcdRaft defines configuration which must be set when the "etcdraft"
  # orderertype is chosen.
